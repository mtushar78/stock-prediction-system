  buy_threshold: 80
  
  # Score >= wait_threshold → WAIT signal
  wait_threshold: 45
  
  # Score < wait_threshold → IGNORE signal

# Logging
logging:
  level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"

# Notes:
# - Adjust rvol_threshold higher (e.g., 3.0) for more selective signals
# - Adjust buy_threshold lower (e.g., 75) for more opportunities
# - Increase min_volume for more liquid stocks only
# - Adjust scoring weights to emphasize different factors
